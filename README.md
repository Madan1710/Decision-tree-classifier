##Decision-Tree-Classifier
<li>A decision tree is a tool that uses a tree-like model set of decisions that lead the user to the answer. Decision trees are commonly used in operations research, specifically in decision analysis, to help identify a strategy most likely to reach a goal.
<li>This repository demonstrates how to implement a decision tree classifier. It includes model training, testing, accuracy evaluation, and visualization.

#Visualization
The decision tree structure can be visualized to interpret how decisions are made.
Insights from the tree can help improve interpretability and optimize the model.

#Features
<li>Load Iris dataset**: Uses sklearn's built-in dataset.
<li>Train-test split**: Splits data into training and testing sets.
<li>Train a decision tree**: Uses `DecisionTreeClassifier` from sklearn.
<li>Evaluate accuracy**: Compares predictions against true labels.
<li>Tree visualization**: Generates a graphical representation of the decision tree.

Dataset
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers classified into three species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

Requirements
- Python 3.8+
